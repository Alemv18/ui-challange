For this project I decided to use HTML and CSS and for making it responsive the use of media queries and 
Boostrap.

The reason I took this path is because I wanted to show that I can make anything from scratch and my love 
for making every detail of my designs look good.

After this test, I would love to have an opportunity to show some of my portfolio of work done, so you can get to 
see some of my designs and professional experience.
